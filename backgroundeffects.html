    <p>Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is the most popular sport in the world, played and watched by
        millions
        across every continent. It is governed globally by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), and
        its
        most prestigious tournament, the FIFA World Cup, is held every four years and draws in billions of viewers. The
        game is
        played between two teams of 11 players each, and the objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the
        opposing
        team’s net. Football is not only a sport but also a cultural phenomenon, uniting people across races, religions,
        and
        borders.

        The sport’s origin dates back to ancient civilizations, but modern football began in 19th-century England with
        the
        establishment of rules by the Football Association in 1863. Today, professional football leagues exist in nearly
        every
        country, with elite clubs like Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Barcelona enjoying global fan bases. Great
        players
        like Pelé, Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo have left a lasting impact on the game. Football
        also
        plays a significant role in economic and social development, offering opportunities, inspiring youth, and even
        influencing politics in various regions.
