    <p>Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in countries like India, England, Australia,
        Pakistan, and South Africa. The game originated in England in the 16th century and gradually spread across the
        British
        Empire. It is played between two teams of eleven players each, and the formats include Test matches, One Day
        Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) games. The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the sport and
        organizes
        major tournaments like the Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy, and T20 World Cup. Test cricket is the
        longest
        format, often lasting five days, while T20 is the shortest and most fast-paced.
