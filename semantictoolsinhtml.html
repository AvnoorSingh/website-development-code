                <h1>Facts About Airplane</h1>
                <p>
                    Airplanes are one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century, revolutionizing
                    transportation by enabling
                    fast, long-distance travel across continents and oceans. The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur,
                    flew the first powered
                    airplane in 1903 in North Carolina, USA. Since then, aviation technology has advanced rapidly, with
                    modern commercial
                    jets capable of flying at altitudes above 35,000 feet and speeds over 900 km/h. Airplanes rely on
                    the principles of
                    aerodynamics, especially lift, thrust, drag, and weight, to stay in the air and navigate through
                    various weather
                    conditions.</p>

                    Planes serve multiple purposes beyond passenger transport. Cargo aircraft deliver goods across the
                    globe, while military
                    planes are used for defense, surveillance, and strategic missions. Special aircraft also help in
                    firefighting, medical
                    emergencies, and scientific research. Aircraft are designed with high safety standards and undergo
                    regular maintenance
                    to ensure passenger and crew safety. The aviation industry continues to evolve with efforts toward
                    sustainable flying,
                    including the development of electric planes and the use of alternative fuels to reduce carbon
                    emissions.
